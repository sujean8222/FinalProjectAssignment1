## Idea Brainstorm

1. **Modern Day Witch Trials
- Comparing Scottish witch trials to “trials” against women today, who are most targeted, and why does this happen: is it age, gender, alignments

2. **Social Scientists Before Congress
- Exploration into the social sphere of science and what was considered threatening to congress. How has that changed and what is the context that surrounds those trials.

3. **Wikipedia editor activity
- What and who is the most edited wikipedia page and why

4. **A database of graphic novels
- Is or will there be a resurgence of graphic novels?

5. **Marvel database
- How has the diversity of marvel characters changed over time? Can we predict new marvel movies and what does this mean for Hollywood and representation?
